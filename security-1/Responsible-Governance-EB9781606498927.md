Book Description
-----------------

Evolving stories of governance and change are being written into the emerging custom and practice of all kinds of organizations today, whether they are global or domestic, startup or blue chip, corporate or government agency. Changing ways of ‘doing business’ are not new, nor is globalization of business, but the velocity and trajectory of both  are rapidly accelerating beyond those seen in previous times. There are increasing concerns and challenges for the boards of directors and other governance systems and processes. They are intended to ensure good stewardship of the diverse organizations in the period following the global   nancial crisis. Responsible Governance aims to challenge assumptions and present current debates for readers, grounding the critical issues or descriptions in relevant historical and social contexts as well as suggesting ways forward. Dr Tom Cockburn obtained his    rst degree with honors from Leicester University, England, both his MBA and Doctorate were gained at Cardiff University, Wales. Tom is associate fellow of the New Zealand Institute of Management and is currently director-policy for the Center for Dynamic Leadership Models in Global Business and a senior associate of The Leadership Alliance Inc., headquartered in Canada.

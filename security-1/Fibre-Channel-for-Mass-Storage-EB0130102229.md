 1022B-8
Master Fibre Channel, the next-generation standard for enterprise storage!
With Fibre Channel, you can suddenly scale your storage systems from gigabytes to terabytes, and improve performance at the same time -- all without disrupting systems, networks, or applications. Fibre Channel for Mass Storage walks you step-by-step through the basics of Fibre Channel technology, and demonstrates how to deploy Hewlett Packard's advanced Fibre Channel products to address your most critical enterprise storage challenges. Coverage includes:
Why Fibre Channel has become the enterprise storage technology of choice
Fibre Channel's architecture and six functional levels
Fibre Channel Arbitrated Loop (FC-AL) -- an exceptionally effective storage system topology
Peripheral devices, logical units, and volume set addressing
Essential addressing techniques for integrating Fibre Channel with HP-UX
Fibre Channel for Mass Storage introduces Hewlett-Packard's state-of-the-art Fibre Channel product family, beginning with Tachyon(r), the industry's first Fibre Channel controller fully integrated on a single chip. Learn about Hewlett-Packard's Fibre Channel adapters for K-Class, T-Class, D-Class, and V-Class Enterprise Servers and parallel clusters; hubs, disk arrays, SCSI multiplexers, and more. Finally, preview the future of Fibre Channel: faster fiber rates, hunt groups, multicast groups, classes of service, and beyond.
Whether you're implementing Fibre Channel, planning for it, or simply need to understand it, Fibre Channel for Mass Storage has all the answers you're looking for.

Book Description
-----------------

Cyber-crime increasingly impacts both the online and offline world, and targeted attacks play a significant role in disrupting services in both. Targeted attacks are those that are aimed at a particular individual, group, or type of site or service. Unlike worms and viruses that usually attack indiscriminately, targeted attacks involve intelligence-gathering and planning to a degree that drastically changes its profile.
Individuals, corporations, and even governments are facing new threats from targeted attacks. Targeted Cyber Attacks examines real-world examples of directed attacks and provides insight into what techniques and resources are used to stage these attacks so that you can counter them more effectively. 
A well-structured introduction into the world of targeted cyber-attacksIncludes analysis of real-world attacksWritten by cyber-security researchers and experts              Cyber-crime increasingly impacts both the online and offline world, and targeted attacks play a significant role in disrupting services in both.

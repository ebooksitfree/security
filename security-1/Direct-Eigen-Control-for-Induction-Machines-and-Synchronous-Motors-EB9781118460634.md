Book Description
-----------------

Clear presentation of a new control process applied to induction machine (IM), surface mounted permanent magnet synchronous motor (SMPM-SM) and interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPM-SM)
Direct Eigen Control for Indusction Machines and Synchronous Motors provides a clear and consise explanation of a new method in alternating current (AC) motor control. Unlike similar books on the market, it does not present various control algorithms for each type of AC motor but explains one method designed to control all AC motor types: Induction Machine (IM), Surface Mounted Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (SMPM-SM) (i.e. Brushless) and Interior Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (IPM-SM). This totally new control method can be used not only for AC motor control but also to control input filter current and voltage of an inverter feeding an AC motor.
Accessible and clear, describes a new fast type of motor control applied to induction machine (IM), surface mounted permanent magnet synchronous motor (SM-PMSM) and interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (I-PMSM) with various examples
Summarizes a method that supersedes the two known direct control solutions – Direct Self Control and Direct Torque Control – to be used for AC motor control and to control input filter current and voltage of an inverter feeding an AC motor
Presents comprehensive simulations that are easy for the reader to reproduce on a computer. A control program is hosted on a companion website
This book is straight-forward with clear mathematical description. It presents simulations in a way that is easy to understand and to reproduce on a computer, whilst omitting details of practical hardware implementation of control, in order for the main theory to take focus. The book remains concise by leaving out description of sensorless controls for all motor types. The sections on "Control Process", "Real Time Implementation" and "Kalman Filter Observer and Prediction" in the introductory chapters explain how to practically implement, in real time, the discretized control with all three types of AC motors. In order, this book describes induction machine, SMPM-SM, IPM-SM, and, application to LC filter limitations. The appendixes present: PWM vector calculations; transfer matrix calculation; transfer matrix inversion; Eigen state space vector calculation; and, transition and command matrix calculation.
Essential reading for Researchers in the field of drive control; graduate and post-graduate students studying electric machines; electric engineers in the field of railways, electric cars, plane surface control, military applications. The approach is also valuable for Engineers in the field of machine tools, robots and rolling mills.

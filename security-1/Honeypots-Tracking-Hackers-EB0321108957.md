Book Description
-----------------

"The text is comprehensive, an honest survey of every honeypot technology I had ever heard of and a number I read about for the first time." --Stephen Northcutt, The SANS Institute
"One of the great byproducts of Lance's work with honeypots and honeynets is that he's helped give us a much clearer picture of the hacker in action." --From the Foreword by Marcus J. Ranum
"From the basics of shrink-wrapped honeypots that catch script kiddies to the detailed architectures of next-generation honeynets for trapping more sophisticated bad guys, this book covers it all....This book really delivers new information and insight about one of the most compelling information security technologies today." --Ed Skoudis, author of Counter Hack, SANS instructor, and Vice President of Security Strategy for Predictive Systems
Honeypots are unique technological systems specifically designed to be probed, attacked, or compromised by an online attacker. Implementing a honeypot provides you with an unprecedented ability to take the offensive against hackers. Whether used as simple "burglar alarms," incident response systems, or tools for gathering information about hacker motives and tactics, honeypots can add serious firepower to your security arsenal.
Honeypots: Tracking Hackers is the ultimate guide to this rapidly growing, cutting-edge technology. The book starts with a basic examination of honeypots and the different roles they can play, and then moves on to in-depth explorations of six specific kinds of real-world honeypots: BackOfficer Friendly, Specter™, Honeyd, Homemade honeypots, ManTrap®, and Honeynets.
Honeypots also includes a chapter dedicated to legal issues surrounding honeypot use. Written with the guidance of three legal experts, this section explores issues of privacy, entrapment, and liability. The book also provides an overview of the Fourth Amendment, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, the Wiretap Act, and the Pen/Trap Statute, with an emphasis on how each applies to honeypots.
With this book you will gain an understanding of honeypot concepts and architecture, as well as the skills to deploy the best honeypot solutions for your environment. You will arm yourself with the expertise needed to track attackers and learn about them on your own. Security professionals, researchers, law enforcement agents, and members of the intelligence and military communities will find this book indispensable.

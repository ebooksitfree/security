Book Description
-----------------

Enterprise security for real netadmins in the real worldThis book shows how to secure an enterprise network in the real world--when you're on the front lines, constantly under attack, and you don't always get the support you need. Symantec security engineer and former UUNet network architect Allan Liska addresses every facet of network security, from risk profiling through access control, Web/email security through day-to-day monitoring. He systematically identifies today's most widespread security mistakes and vulnerabilities--and offers realistic solutions you can begin implementing right away.Coverage Includes:
Quantifying security risks and "selling" security throughout the organization
Defining security models that reflect your company's philosophy
Translating your security model into effective, enforceable policies
Making your routers and switches your first lines of network defense
Controlling access via authentication, authorization, and accounting
Configuring secure VPNs and remote access
Securing wireless LANs and WANs
Establishing a DMZ between your network and the public Internet
Securing Web/application servers, DNS servers, email servers, and file/print servers
Implementing effective day-to-day network security administration, monitoring, and logging
Responding to attacks: detect, isolate, halt, report, and prosecute
Liska integrates these techniques in an end-to-end case study, showing you how to redesign an insecure enterprise network for maximum security--one step at a time.

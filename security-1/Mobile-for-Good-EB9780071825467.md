Book Description
-----------------

"Even if you can only invest 5 staff hours and a mobile and social media budget of $1,000 annually, your nonprofit must invest in mobile and social media." -- Heather Mansfield
Mobile devices are fast becoming the #1 means of digital communication. If you want a sustainable future for  your nonprofit, you need to have a strong  presence on prospective donors' tablets and  smartphones.
Statistics prove that the most successful online fundraising campaigns are those designed for portable devices--from 2-inch smartphone screens to 17-inch laptops. In this groundbreaking book, social media pioneer  Heather Mansfield offers everything you need to know to conceptualize, build, and maintain a mobile and social fundraising strategy to dramatically increase donations.  In Mobile for Good, Mansfield takes you step by step through the entire process. Learn how to:
Master your mobile fundraising strategy  Create a strategic plan flexible enough to handle changes in technology  Design a website and emails that work  on both mobile devices and computers  Choose the best mobile and online tools based on your budget and your donor demographics  Build a system that tracks, evaluates, and reports campaign results  Maximize the potential of Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and other sitesWhether your goal is to raise more funds online, launch a new program, or increase your capacity to maintain current operations, creating and executing a mobile and  social media strategy is a small investment that packs a big punch. Apply the lessons of Mobile for Good, and your organization can and will raise more funds than ever.

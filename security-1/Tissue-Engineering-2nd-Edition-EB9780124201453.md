Book Description
-----------------

Tissue Engineering is a comprehensive introduction to the engineering and biological aspects of this critical subject. With contributions from internationally renowned authors, it provides a broad perspective on tissue engineering for students coming to the subject for the first time. In addition to the key topics covered in the previous edition, this update also includes new material on the regulatory authorities, commercial considerations as well as new chapters on microfabrication, materiomics and cell/biomaterial interface.
Effectively reviews major foundational topics in tissue engineering in a clear and accessible fashionIncludes state of the art experiments presented in break-out boxes, chapter objectives, chapter summaries, and multiple choice questions to aid learningNew edition contains material on regulatory authorities and commercial considerations in tissue engineering

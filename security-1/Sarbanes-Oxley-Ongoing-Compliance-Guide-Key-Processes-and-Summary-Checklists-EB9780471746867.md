Book Description
-----------------

Quick and easy implementation and maintenance guide for ongoing Sarbanes-Oxley compliance For most companies, achieving compliance to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) has proven to be more challenging, and more costly, than initially anticipated. In many cases, initial and second-year compliance efforts were found to have strained company resources, causing a shift of focus away from such areas as internal audit in order to meet SOX requirements. Sarbanes-Oxley Ongoing Compliance Guide: Key Processes and Summary Checklists provides controllers, CFOs, and auditors with step-by-step guidance to setting up an ongoing compliance program for SOX in a quick, easy-to-follow manner. This essential book discusses crucial issues such as who should spearhead Sarbanes-Oxley compliance, how it should be set up, and which SOX issues need to be monitored by function. Highlighting the key issues that need to be addressed, this book provides your organization with practical tools including customizable checklists sorted by function for the SOX implications that correspond to various business functions, such as finance, accounting, IT, and management fields. Today, more than ever, a properly structured internal audit function can be a tremendous benefit to an organization, impacting not only regulatory compliance, but also operational excellence. Concise and clear in presentation, Sarbanes-Oxley Ongoing Compliance Guide: Key Processes and Summary Checklists shows you how to help your organization put in place a successful enterprise risk management program. This important book arms you with the vital components of a detailed compliance plan that makes the most of technology to assist in reducing ongoing compliance costs.

Book Description
-----------------

The best-practice guide to managing IT infrastructures–now fully updated!
IT Systems Management is an up-to-the-minute guide to maintaining stable, responsive IT production environments. Top IT systems management expert Rich Schiesser illuminates both the theoretical and practical aspects of systems management, using methods and examples drawn from decades of experience leading and consulting with the world’s most complex enterprise IT organizations.
This thoroughly updated edition covers every systems management discipline  and all elements of success: people, process, and technology. Schiesser shows how to apply best-practice system management throughout all IT infrastructure environments, from mainframe data centers to web-enabled systems, client/server and mid-range platforms to wireless and VoIP networks. 
Schiesser systematically addresses today’s most crucial issues, as well as emerging trends that will transform IT systems management. You’ll find an entirely new chapter on using IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL) effectively, plus new coverage ranging from managing outsourced functions to efficiently delivering “ultra-speed” Internet connections. This edition includes more real-life examples throughout, and new interactive problems designed to give IT professionals even deeper insight. Coverage includes:
•  Implementing bullet-proof processes in areas ranging from change management to production acceptance, capacity planning to storage
•  Optimizing the “people” components of IT service delivery, from customer service to executive support
•  Using technology to manage systems more efficiently and effectively
•  Systematically managing performance, availability, and business continuity
•  Reducing the cost and complexity of IT facilities management
•  Taking a more strategic approach to security

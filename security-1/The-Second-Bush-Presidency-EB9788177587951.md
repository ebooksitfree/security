Book Description
-----------------

The Second Bush Presidency: Global Perspectives contains nine national perspectives on what a second Bush term portends for the world. Taken on one yardstick, five of the countries chosen (including the US) are members of the Security Council; using another, four are members of the BRIC quartet, emerging economies whose potential is such that they are expected to dominate the world economy in the years to come. All these countries have a difficult job of fashioning their foreign policy responses to the US while keeping in view their own national objectives as well as a host of other factors. The contributors to this book analyse not only the tangible factors but also the various intangibles--the personal equations the leaders of these countries have with their American counterpart as well as domestic equations within the United States to make up a whole that is at once interesting and enlightening. This book attempts to be a modest primer for policy makers in this direction: a must-read for policy makers in every part of the globe.

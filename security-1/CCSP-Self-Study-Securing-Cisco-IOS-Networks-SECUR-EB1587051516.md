Configure AAA support on perimeter Cisco routers and Cisco IOS Firewalls
Implement standard practices to secure administrative access and disable unused router protocols, services, and interfaces
Use AutoSecure to configure security parameters on Cisco routers
Configure Cisco IOS Firewalls for CBAC, Authentication Proxy, and AAA support
Configure and manage Cisco IOS IDS router signatures and audit rules
Monitor Cisco IOS IDS routers using Security Monitor or Syslog servers
Configure IPSec VPN tunnels on Cisco routers using preshared keys or RSA signatures
Configure Cisco routers to use IPSec with Network Address Translation
Use Security Device Manager and Router Management Center to configure and manage Cisco IOS VPN and Cisco IOS Firewall policies
Mitigate common router security threats with access control lists (ACLs)
CCSP Self-Study: Securing Cisco IOS Networks (SECUR) is a complete reference for security practices, protocols, software, and equipment that work on or in conjunction with Cisco IOS equipment to provide layers of security to networks. In addition to acting as a key study aid for the CCSP SECUR 642-501 exam, this book will be an invaluable theory and configuration guide for years to come.
CCSP Self-Study: Securing Cisco IOS Networks (SECUR) is a Cisco authorized, self-paced learning tool that helps you gain mastery over all security techniques and technologies, including newer topics such as Cisco Easy VPN and Security Device Manager (SDM). Chapter overviews bring you quickly up to speed on technologies you can use to secure your network. Configuration examples are designed to show you how to make Cisco IOS devices secure, and unique chapter-ending review questions test your knowledge.
Whether you are seeking a reference guide to working with Cisco IOS security or a study guide for the 642-501 exam, CCSP Self-Study: Securing Cisco IOS Networks (SECUR) is the reference you are looking for.
CCSP Self-Study: Securing Cisco IOS Networks (SECUR) is part of a recommended learning path from Cisco Systems that includes simulation and hands-on training from authorized Cisco Learning Partners and self-study products from Cisco Press.

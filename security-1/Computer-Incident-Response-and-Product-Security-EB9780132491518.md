Book Description
-----------------

Learn how to build a Security Incident Response team with guidance from a leading SIRT from Cisco
Gain insight into the best practices of one of the foremost incident response teams
Master your plan for building a SIRT (Security Incidence Response Team) with detailed guidelines and expert advice for incident handling and response
Review legal issues from a variety of national perspectives, and consider practical aspects of coordination with other organizations
Network Security Incident Response provides practical guidelines for building an SIRT team as well offering advice on responding to actual incidents. For many companies, incident response is new territory. Some companies do not have an incidence response team at all. Some would like to have one but need guidance to start and others would like to improve existing practices. Today, there are only a handful of organizations that do have mature and experienced teams. For that reason this book is structured to provide help in both creating and running an effective Security Incident Response Team. Organizations who are evaluating whether to invest in a SIRT or who are just getting started building one will find the information in this book to be invaluable in helping them understand the nature of the threats, justifying resources, and building effective IR (Incidence Response) teams. Established IR teams will also benefit from the best practices highlighted in building IR teams as well as information on the current state of incident response handling, incident coordination, and legal issues. Written by a leading SIRT (Security Incident Response Team) from Cisco, the expertise and guidance provided in this book will serve as the blueprint for successful incidence response planning for most any organization.

Book Description
-----------------

Do you know what your IT systems cost your business in electricity?
Organisations are not always aware of how much of their electricity bill goes on data storage. This is because the amount of money they are spending on the electricity for IT systems is often hidden inside the bigger electricity bill. Many businesses have already been confronted with the heavy operational costs associated with increased data storage. So unless you keep track of the problem, your business may be pouring money down the drain without you even realising it. If you care at all about growth, this is a form of waste you cannot afford. Moreover, a sudden rise in electricity prices may even push your company into making disruptive, short-term cuts. 
Brand equityHeavy use of electricity also has a negative impact on the environment. Generating electricity usually requires the burning of fossil fuels, which releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. In today's business climate, environmental irresponsibility results in bad publicity, and leads to awkward questions from both customers and investors. Getting to grips with energy consumption is one way for you to protect your company's reputation. 
What gets measured gets done
This book's message has nothing to do with greenwash. It is intended for people who are looking for hard, practical advice on how to fix a problem. Green IT needs to establish baseline data so that progress can be effectively tracked, and metrics are essential for that. Taking Green IT seriously also means coming up with a plan and making sure it gets delivered. So it is vital to treat Green IT as a process. You need to make the CIO responsible for the energy consumption of the data centre, and allow him to do what it takes to drive costs down. To retain momentum, your Green IT strategy also needs the support of top management. Meanwhile, lower down the hierarchy, employees need to know that Green IT is not just a fad, but something your company is treating as a real priority.

Manage power demand      Once servers start to become overloaded with work, more servers have to be installed, meaning increased consumption of electricity.

Book Description
-----------------

Decisions Without Hierarchy is based on a two-year examination of three feminist organizations: a peace group, health collective, and business women's group. From these case studies, Iannello constructs a model of organizations that, while structured, is nevertheless non-hierarchical. She terms this organization from the "modified consensus model." Her case studies show that modified consensus does not give way to pressures toward formal hierarchy and that, therefore, the model merits the attention of feminists and organization theorists alike.

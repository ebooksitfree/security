Book Description
-----------------

Reconsider how you view compliance – and your business will reap the rewards!
A must have book for anyone who is looking to develop awareness and deeper insight into IT controls, strategies and techniques to solve compliance challenges!What does 'compliance' mean to you? Is it a burden, a box-ticking exercise, or a way to avoid the penalties of non-compliance? Or do you see the opportunities it presents for your business? 
In Compliance by Design, Chong Ee will show you how your organisation can benefit from becoming compliant with the relevant national and international standards. You will discover how integrating controls into your processes will improve your security, increase your productivity, save you time and money, and increase your profits. 
Drawing on personal experience and using up-to-date, practical examples, the book considers the elements and principles of controls, and offers strategies to put them in place. It will show you how to: 
implement changes that will improve your processes  allay fears and overcome resistance from your stakeholders  integrate controls into your everyday processes  achieve synergy from interconnected processes  assess your priorities and handle conflicting objectives  analyse and manage risks  establish a system of controls that is right for your business  manage your technology to make it work for you. Moving away from traditional efforts
Traditional efforts in attaining or sustaining IT compliance employ an outside-looking-in approach, characterised by capturing varied compliance requirements and/or frameworks and applying these within the organisation. This book advocates an inside-looking-out approach, emphasising fundamental ideas of good control design as the basis for developing effective and sustainable IT compliance strategies. 
Tools and techniques
Intended to arm you with the tools and techniques to put in place the right system of internal controls, the focus is on IT controls, but with plenty of references to business and entity controls, too. 
What others are saying about this book ...
'As the title implies Chong Ee offers the reader a "Journey to unravel the essence of IT Controls." The book moves quickly and raises a lot of thought provoking questions, providing windows into compliance: Elements, Principles and Strategies. Not a classic check list of controls, this book encourages thinking, which I see as very beneficial when designing IT controls. It is well worth the read.'

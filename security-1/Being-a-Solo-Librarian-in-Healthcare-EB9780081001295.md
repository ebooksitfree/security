Book Description
-----------------

This book brings to light the current job responsibilities of the healthcare librarian, but at the same time reveals a dichotomy. In theory, advances in healthcare research promise better care and improved safety for patients. In practice, there are barriers that undermine change. The author calls attention to the underutilized healthcare librarian at a time when clinical information delivery to the doctor or nurse is equal to or more important than how wired the hospital is. This is a book for healthcare stakeholders who support evidence-based practice and for those considering entering medical librarianship. The profession is in flux as hospitals must decide whether they can afford a library and librarian or whether they can afford not to have one.
Discusses current trends in healthcare librarianshipDescribes the daily job duties of a hospital librarianLooks at barriers to hospitals practicing evidence-based medicineConnects improved patient care to healthcare librarian services              This book brings to light the current job responsibilities of the healthcare librarian, but at the same time reveals a dichotomy.

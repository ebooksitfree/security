Book Description
-----------------

Network Defense and Countermeasures:
Principles and Practices
Everything you need to know about modern network attacks and defense, in one book
Clearly explains core network security concepts, challenges, technologies, and skills
 Thoroughly updated for the latest attacks and countermeasures
The perfect beginner’s guide for anyone interested in a network security career
Security is the IT industry’s hottest topic–and that’s where the hottest opportunities are, too. Organizations desperately need professionals who can help them safeguard against the most sophisticated attacks ever created–attacks from well-funded global criminal syndicates, and even governments.
Today, security begins with defending the organizational network. Network Defense and Countermeasures, Second Edition is today’s most complete, easy-to-understand introduction to modern network attacks and their effective defense.
From malware and DDoS attacks to firewalls and encryption, Chuck Easttom blends theoretical foundations with up-to-the-minute best-practice techniques. Starting with the absolute basics, he discusses crucial topics many security books overlook, including the emergence of network-based espionage and terrorism.
If you have a basic understanding of networks, that’s all the background you’ll need to succeed with this book: no math or advanced computer science is required. You’ll find projects, questions, exercises, case studies, links to expert resources, and a complete glossary–all designed to deepen your understanding and prepare you to defend real-world networks.
Chuck Easttom has worked in all aspects of IT, including network administration, software engineering, and IT management. For several years, he has taught IT topics in college and corporate environments, worked as an independent IT consultant, and served as an expert witness in court cases involving computers. He holds 28 industry certifications, including CISSP, ISSAP, Certified Ethical Hacker, Certified Hacking Forensics Investigator, EC Council Certified Security Administrator, and EC Council Certified Instructor. He served as subject matter expert for CompTIA in its development or revision of four certification tests, including Security+. He recently assisted the EC Council in developing its new advanced cryptography course. Easttom has authored 13 books on topics including computer security and crime.

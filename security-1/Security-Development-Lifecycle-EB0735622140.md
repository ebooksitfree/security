Book Description
-----------------

Your customers demand and deserve better security and privacy in their software. This book is the first to detail a rigorous, proven methodology that measurably minimizes security bugs—the Security Development Lifecycle (SDL). In this long-awaited book, security experts Michael Howard and Steve Lipner from the Microsoft Security Engineering Team guide you through each stage of the SDL—from education and design to testing and post-release. You get their first-hand insights, best practices, a practical history of the SDL, and lessons to help you implement the SDL in any development organization. 
Discover how to:
Use a streamlined risk-analysis process to find security design issues before code is committedApply secure-coding best practices and a proven testing process Conduct a final security review before a product shipsArm customers with prescriptive guidance to configure and deploy your product more securelyEstablish a plan to respond to new security vulnerabilitiesIntegrate security discipline into agile methods and processes, such as Extreme Programming and ScrumIncludes a CD featuring:
A six-part security class video conducted by the authors and other Microsoft security expertsSample SDL documents and fuzz testing toolPLUS—Get book updates on the Web.

Andrew Mason
ISBN-10: 1-58705-329-2
ISBN-13: 978-1-58705-329-0
Cisco Firewall Technologies provides you with a no-nonsense, easy-to-read guide to different types of firewall technologies along with information on how these technologies are represented in the Cisco® firewall product family. The main Cisco products covered are the IOS® Firewall, the PIX® Firewall, and the ASA. The majority of focus for the Short Cut will be on the ASA and emphasis will be placed upon the latest functionality released in version 7.2. The Short Cut also provides a walkthrough for configuring the ASA using the Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM), the GUI management and configuration tool provided with the ASA.
The Short Cut presents you with the background information and product knowledge to make qualified decisions about the type of firewall technology that best fits your working environment. This is a Cisco technology focused Short Cut, so the emphasis will be solely on Cisco firewall products.

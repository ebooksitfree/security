Book Description
-----------------

Proven and emerging strategies for addressing document and records management risk within the framework of information governance principles and best practices
Information Governance (IG) is a rapidly emerging "super discipline" and is now being applied to electronic document and records management, email, social media, cloud computing, mobile computing, and, in fact, the management and output of information organization-wide. IG leverages information technologies to enforce policies, procedures and controls to manage information risk in compliance with legal and litigation demands, external regulatory requirements, and internal governance objectives. Information Governance: Concepts, Strategies, and Best Practices reveals how, and why, to utilize IG and leverage information technologies to control, monitor, and enforce information access and security policies.
Written by one of the most recognized and published experts on information governance, including specialization in e-document security and electronic records management
Provides big picture guidance on the imperative for information governance and best practice guidance on electronic document and records management
Crucial advice and insights for compliance and risk managers, operations managers, corporate counsel, corporate records managers, legal administrators, information technology managers, archivists, knowledge managers, and information governance professionals
IG sets the policies that control and manage the use of organizational information, including social media, mobile computing, cloud computing, email, instant messaging, and the use of e-documents and records. This extends to e-discovery planning and preparation. Information Governance: Concepts, Strategies, and Best Practices provides step-by-step guidance for developing information governance strategies and practices to manage risk in the use of electronic business documents and records.

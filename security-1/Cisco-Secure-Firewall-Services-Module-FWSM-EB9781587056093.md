Cisco Secure Firewall Services Module (FWSM)
Best practices for securing networks with FWSM
Ray Blair, CCIE速 No. 7050
Arvind Durai, CCIE No. 7016
The Firewall Services Module (FWSM) is a high-performance stateful-inspection firewall that integrates into the Cisco速 6500 switch and 7600 router chassis. The FWSM monitors traffic flows using application inspection engines to provide a strong level of network security. The FWSM defines the security parameter and enables the enforcement of security policies through authentication, access control lists, and protocol inspection. The FWSM is a key component to anyone deploying network security.
Cisco Secure Firewall Services Module (FWSM) covers all aspects of the FWSM. The book provides a detailed look at how the FWSM processes information, as well as installation advice, configuration details, recommendations for network integration, and reviews of operation and management. This book provides you with a single source that comprehensively answers how and why the FWSM functions as it does. This information enables you to successfully deploy the FWSM and gain the greatest functional benefit from your deployment. Practical examples throughout show you how other customers have successfully deployed the FWSM.
By reading this book, you will learn how the FWSM functions, the differences between the FWSM and the ASA Security Appliance, how to implement and maintain the FWSM, the latest features of the FWSM, and how to configure common installations.

Book Description
-----------------

The mobile industry is evolving rapidly. An increasing number of mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, are sold every year and more people are accessing services from a mobile device than ever before. For an enterprise, this can mean that a growing number of customers, business partners, and even employees now expect to access services on a mobile channel. This opens new opportunities for the business but also presents new challenges, both in terms of business processes and information technology (IT) infrastructure.
IBM® Worklight® is an open mobile application platform. It helps organizations of all sizes to efficiently develop, connect, run, and manage HTML5, hybrid, and native applications. IBM Worklight provides the essential elements needed for complete mobile application development, deployment, and management within a business.
This IBM Redbooks® publication provides information necessary to design, develop, deploy, and maintain mobile applications using IBM Worklight Version 5.0.5. It includes information about decision points that the IT organization will need to make, the roles that are involved in a mobile strategy and the responsibilities of the individuals in those roles. It also describes integration points with other IBM products that can enhance the mobile solution. This book has two parts:
Part 1 is for a business-oriented IT audience and addresses business aspects of the mobile industry. It is for the IT architect or CTO, who can translate business needs into information technology solutions
Part 2 is intended for a technical audience, including application developers, testers, and system administrators.

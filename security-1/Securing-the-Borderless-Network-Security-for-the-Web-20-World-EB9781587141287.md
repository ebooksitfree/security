Securing the Borderless Network: Security for the Web 2.0 World
Tom Gillis
Securing the Borderless Network reveals New techniques for securing advanced Web 2.0, virtualization, mobility, and collaborative applications
Today’s new Web 2.0, virtualization, mobility, telepresence, and collaborative applications offer immense potential for enhancing productivity and competitive advantage. However, they also introduce daunting new security issues, many of which are already being exploited by cybercriminals. Securing the Borderless Network is the first book entirely focused on helping senior IT decision-makers understand, manage, and mitigate the security risks of these new collaborative technologies.
Cisco® security technology expert Tom Gillis brings together systematic, timely decision-making and technical guidance for companies of all sizes: information and techniques for protecting collaborative systems without compromising their business benefits. You’ll walk through multiple scenarios and case studies, from Cisco Webex® conferencing to social networking to cloud computing. For each scenario, the author identifies key security risks and presents proven best-practice responses, both technical and nontechnical.
Securing the Borderless Network reviews the latest Cisco technology solutions for managing identity and securing networks, content, endpoints, and applications. The book concludes by discussing the evolution toward "Web 3.0" applications and the Cisco security vision for the borderless enterprise, providing you with a complete security overview for this quickly evolving network paradigm.

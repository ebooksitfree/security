Book Description
-----------------

 75% of companies without a business continuity plan fail within three years.  Disruptive incidents can affect any organization and occur at any moment. ICT outages, cyber attacks, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, pandemics, supply chain failures and other unexpected events can all affect productivity and in many cases place a company&#8217;s survival in serious jeopardy.  Business continuity planning is essential to overcoming business disruptions, but too many companies prepare business continuity plans and then shelve them, only for those plans to fail when they&#8217;re actually needed.  80% of companies that have not recovered from a disaster within one month go out of business.  A business continuity plan that isn&#8217;t validated isn&#8217;t a plan at all &#8211; it&#8217;s merely a strategy. Indeed, in some cases an untested plan is worse than no plan at all. In spite of this, only 30% of businesses actually validate their business continuity plans.     Product overview  Business continuity planning is a process of continual improvement, not a matter of writing a plan and then putting your feet up. Attempting to validate every aspect of your plan, however &#8211; particularly in a live rehearsal situation &#8211; could create a disaster of your own making.Validating Your Business Continuity Plan examines the three essential components of validating a business continuity plan &#8211; exercising, maintenance and review &#8211; and outlines a controlled and systematic approach to BCP validation while considering each component, covering methods and techniques such as table-top reviews, workshops, and live rehearsals.  The book also takes account of industry standards and guidelines to help steer the reader through the validation process, including the international standard ISO 22301 and the Business Continuity Institute&#8217;s Good Practice Guidelines.  In addition, it provides a number of case studies based on the author&#8217;s considerable experience &#8211; some of them successful, others less so &#8211; to highlight common pitfalls and problems associated with the validation process.

Book Description
-----------------

This book was written to increase the public understanding of 'accountability'. The author constructs a three-dimensional lens with which he examines the mechanisms that hold our governance institutions accountable. Desai explains why a burst of governance reforms are sorely needed and describes how the journey of accountability will play out over the next few decades. Those who read this book will transit from a state of angst about accountability, to one of awareness and finally into action. India will then truly make its 'tryst with destiny'.

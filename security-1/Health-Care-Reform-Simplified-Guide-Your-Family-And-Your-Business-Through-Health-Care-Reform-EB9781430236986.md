Book Description
-----------------

Health Care Reform Simplified describes the new Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. It translates the law's complex language into terms that are easy to understand, explaining what the new law does, when its provisions take effect, and how to plan for individual, family, and business coverage. This book outlines the financial impact of the new law and how it affects businesses, insurers, hospitals, and doctors.
Most important, this book gives consumers and employers the critical information they need to make informed choices about many new options for private and public health insurance coverage. It also describes how the new law interacts with Medicare and Medicaid. Finally, it looks at the potential roadblocks—political and judicial, as well as economic—that may derail some of the provisions. But with nearly half the Act's provisions in force already, there is no time to lose in understanding how the Affordable Care Act affects U.S. health care providers and consumers today.

Book Description
-----------------

The complete guide to today’s hard-to-defend chained attacks: performing them and preventing them
Nowadays, it’s rare for malicious hackers to rely on just one exploit or tool; instead, they use “chained” exploits that integrate multiple forms of attack to achieve their goals. Chained exploits are far more complex and far more difficult to defend. Few security or hacking books cover them well and most don’t cover them at all. Now there’s a book that brings together start-to-finish information about today’s most widespread chained exploits–both how to perform them and how to prevent them.
Chained Exploits demonstrates this advanced hacking attack technique through detailed examples that reflect real-world attack strategies, use today’s most common attack tools, and focus on actual high-value targets, including credit card and healthcare data. Relentlessly thorough and realistic, this book covers the full spectrum of attack avenues, from wireless networks to physical access and social engineering.
Writing for security, network, and other IT professionals, the authors take you through each attack, one step at a time, and then introduce today’s most effective countermeasures— both technical and human. Coverage includes:
Constructing convincing new phishing attacks
Discovering which sites other Web users are visiting
Wreaking havoc on IT security via wireless networks
Disrupting competitors’ Web sites
Performing–and preventing–corporate espionage
Destroying secure files
Gaining access to private healthcare records
Attacking the viewers of social networking pages
Creating entirely new exploits
and more

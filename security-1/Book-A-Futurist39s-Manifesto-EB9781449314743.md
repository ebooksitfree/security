Book Description
-----------------

The rapid shakeup--from print to digital buying and reading--is a transitional phase, necessary in order to make the next jump, which is far bigger and more exciting: what happens when all books are truly digital, connected, ubiquitous. We're starting to have the infrastructure in place now, so we can start doing things with books never before possible.
This book will be a guidebook for this future: a collection of essays from thought leaders and practitioners about the bleeding-edge of publishing:
The Tools of the Trade: How New Tools Are Shaking Up Publishing
The Things We Do with Books: Projects from the Bleeding Edge
The Future’s So Bright: What Is Next for the Book?

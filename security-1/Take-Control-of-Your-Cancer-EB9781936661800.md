Book Description
-----------------

Cancer rates continue to skyrocket, and the overall survival rate for Stage IV cancer patients in the United States is a grim 2.1 percent. Clearly, the extensive use of expensive, sometimes ineffective toxins in conventional oncology protocols is a failing strategy. Even the few survivors of these harsh slash-and-burn treatments can have dismal quality of life, suffering with ailments such as nerve damage, heart muscle disease, and liver and kidney failure. And unfortunately, many conventional doctors discourage patients from exploring alternative treatment options.
A featured doctor in Suzanne Somers bestselling cancer book Knockout, forty-year oncology veteran James W. Forsythe, MD, HMD, offers a more cost-effective, personalized, and compassionate alternative to traditional cancer treatment in Take Control of Your Cancer: Integrating the Best of Alternative and Conventional Treatments. Dr. Forsythes integrative approach has yielded an astonishing 46 percent positive response rate in a 500-patient study.
In Take Control of Your Cancer, you will find information on all stages of cancer, including:
Warning signs of cancer
How to pinpoint the causes of cancer and to avoid recurrence
Preventative measures such as healthy diet and regular exercise
Overview of how to choose what drugs and supplements to use
How to take charge of your cancer treatment and maintain a positive attitude
Successful case studies of 40 of Dr. Forsythes Stage IV cancer patients
While Dr. Forsythe offers his patients conventional and alternative therapies on their own as well as an integrative option, Take Control of Your Cancer encourages cancer patients and their families to explore their treatment options and look for doctors who personalize treatment for optimal outcomes.

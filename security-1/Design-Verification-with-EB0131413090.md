Book Description
-----------------

Design Verification with eSamir Palnitkar
Written for both experienced and new users, DesignVerification with e gives you a broadcoverage of e. It stresses the practical verification perspective of e rather than emphasizing only itslanguage aspects.
This book—
Introduces you to e-based verification methodologies
Describes e syntax in detail, including structs, units, methods, events, temporal expressions. and TCMs
Explains the concepts of automatic generation, checking and coverage
Discusses the e Reuse Methodology
Describes essential topics such as coverage driven verification, e verification components (eVCs), and interfacing with C/C++
Illustrates a complete verification example in e
Contains a quick-reference guide to the e language
Offers many practical verification tips
Includes over 250 illustrations, examples, andexercises, and a verification resource list. Learning objectives and summariesare provided for each chapter.
“Mr. Palnitkar illustrates how and why the power ofthe everification language and the underlying Specman Elite testbench automationtool are used to develop today's most advanced verification environments. Thisbook is valuable to both the novice and the experienced e user. I highlyrecommend it to anyone exploring functional verification”
—Moshe Gavrielov
Chief Executive Officer
Verisity Design, Inc.
“This book demonstrates how e can be used to createstate-of-the-art verification environments. An ideal book to jumpstarta beginner and a handy reference for experts”
—Rakesh Dodeja
Engineering Manager
Intel Corporation
“The book gives a simple, logical, and well-organizedpresentation of ewith plenty of illustrations. This makes it an ideal text book for universitycourses on functional  verification”
—Dr. Steven Levitan
 Professor
 Department of Electrical Engineering
 University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA
“This book is ideal for readers with little or no e programming experience. It gives the reader athorough and practical understanding of not only the e language, but also how to effectively use thislanguage to develop complex functional verification environments.”
—Bill Schubert
Verification Engineer
ST Microelectronics, Inc.
“The flow of the book is logical and gradual. Plentyof illustrations and examples makes this an ideal book for e users. A must-have for both beginners andexperts”

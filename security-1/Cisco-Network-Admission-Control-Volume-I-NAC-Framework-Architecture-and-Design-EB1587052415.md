Cisco Network Admission Control
Volume I: NAC Framework Architecture and Design
A guide to endpoint compliance enforcement
Today, a variety of security challenges affect all businesses regardless of size and location. Companies face ongoing challenges with the fight against malware such as worms, viruses, and spyware. Today’s mobile workforce attach numerous devices to the corporate network that are harder to control from a security policy perspective. These host devices are often lacking antivirus updates and operating system patches, thus exposing the entire network to infection. As a result, worms and viruses continue to disrupt business, causing downtime and continual patching. Noncompliant servers and desktops are far too common and are difficult to detect and contain. Locating and isolating infected computers is time consuming and resource intensive.
Network Admission Control (NAC) uses the network infrastructure to enforce security policy compliance on all devices seeking to access network computing resources, thereby limiting damage from emerging security threats. NAC allows network access only to compliant and trusted endpoint devices (PCs, servers, and PDAs, for example) and can restrict the access of and even remediate noncompliant devices.
Cisco Network Admission Control, Volume I, describes the NAC architecture and provides an in-depth technical description for each of the solution components. This book also provides design guidelines for enforcing network admission policies and describes how to handle NAC agentless hosts. As a technical primer, this book introduces you to the NAC Framework solution components and addresses the architecture behind NAC and the protocols that it follows so you can gain a complete understanding of its operation. Sample worksheets help you gather and organize requirements for designing a NAC solution.

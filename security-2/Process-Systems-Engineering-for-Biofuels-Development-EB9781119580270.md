Book Description
-----------------

A comprehensive overview of current developments and applications in biofuels production&nbsp;
Process Systems Engineering for Biofuels Development&nbsp;brings together the latest and most cutting-edge research on the production of biofuels. As the first book specifically&nbsp;devoted to process systems engineering&nbsp;for the production of&nbsp;biofuels,&nbsp;Process Systems Engineering for Biofuels Development&nbsp;covers theoretical, computational&nbsp;and experimental issues in biofuels process engineering.&nbsp;
Written for researchers and postgraduate students working on biomass conversion and sustainable process design, as well as industrial practitioners and engineers involved in process design, modeling and optimization, this book is an indispensable guide to the newest developments in areas including:&nbsp;
Enzyme-catalyzed biodiesel production&nbsp;Process analysis of biodiesel production (including kinetic modeling,&nbsp;simulation&nbsp;and optimization)&nbsp;The use of&nbsp;ultrasonification&nbsp;in biodiesel production&nbsp;Thermochemical processes for biomass&nbsp;transformation&nbsp;to biofuels&nbsp;Production of alternative biofuels&nbsp;In addition to the comprehensive overview of the subject of biofuels found in&nbsp;the Introduction&nbsp;of the book, the authors&nbsp;of various chapters&nbsp;have provided&nbsp;extensive&nbsp;discussions of the production and separation of biofuels via novel applications and techniques.&nbsp;

Book Description
-----------------

 Get started with NMAP, OpenVAS, and Metasploit in this short book and understand how NMAP, OpenVAS, and Metasploit can be integrated with each other for greater flexibility and efficiency. You will begin by working with NMAP and ZENMAP and learning the basic scanning and enumeration process. After getting to know the differences between TCP and UDP scans, you will learn to fine tune your scans and efficiently use NMAP scripts. This will be followed by an introduction to OpenVAS vulnerability management system. You will then learn to configure OpenVAS and scan for and report vulnerabilities. The next chapter takes you on a detailed tour of Metasploit and its basic commands and configuration. You will then invoke NMAP and OpenVAS scans from Metasploit. Lastly, you will take a look at scanning services with Metasploit and get to know more about Meterpreter, an advanced, dynamically extensible payload that is extended over the network at runtime.The final part of the book concludes by pentesting a system in a real-world scenario, where you will apply the skills you have learnt.What You Will LearnCarry out basic scanning with NMAPInvoke NMAP from PythonUse vulnerability scanning and reporting with OpenVASMaster common commands in MetasploitWho This Book Is ForReaders new to penetration testing who would like to get a quick start on it.         Show and hide more

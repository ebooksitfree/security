Book Description
-----------------


    
    Start with the basics of bug hunting and learn more about implementing an offensive approach by finding vulnerabilities in web applications. Getting an introduction to Kali Linux, you will take a close look at the types of tools available to you and move on to set up your virtual lab. You will then discover how request forgery injection works on web pages and applications in a mission-critical setup. Moving on to the most challenging task for any web application, you will take a look at how cross-site scripting works and find out about effective ways to exploit it.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
You will then learn about header injection and URL redirection along with key tips to find vulnerabilities in them. Keeping in mind how attackers can deface your website, you will work with malicious files and automate your approach to defend against these attacks. Moving on to Sender Policy Framework (SPF), you will see tips to find vulnerabilities in it and exploit them. Following this, you will get to know how unintended XML injection and command injection work to keep attackers at bay. Finally, you will examine different attack vectors used to exploit HTML and SQL injection. Overall, Bug Bounty Hunting for Web Security will help you become a better penetration tester and at the same time it will teach you how to earn bounty by hunting bugs in web applications.

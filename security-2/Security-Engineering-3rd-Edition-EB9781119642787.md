Book Description
-----------------

Now that there’s software in everything, how can you make anything&nbsp;secure? Understand&nbsp;how to engineer&nbsp;dependable systems&nbsp;with this newly updated&nbsp;classic&nbsp;&nbsp;
In&nbsp;Security Engineering: A Guide to Building Dependable Distributed Systems,&nbsp;Third Edition&nbsp;Cambridge University professor Ross Anderson updates his&nbsp;classic textbook&nbsp;and teaches readers how to design, implement, and test systems&nbsp;to&nbsp;withstand&nbsp;both&nbsp;error&nbsp;and attack.&nbsp;&nbsp;
This&nbsp;book&nbsp;became a best-seller in 2001 and helped establish the discipline of security engineering.&nbsp;By the second edition in 2008,&nbsp;underground dark markets&nbsp;had&nbsp;let the bad guys specialize and&nbsp;scale up;&nbsp;attacks were increasingly on users rather than on technology.&nbsp;The book&nbsp;repeated&nbsp;its&nbsp;success&nbsp;by showing how security engineers can&nbsp;focus on&nbsp;usability.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now&nbsp;the third edition brings it up to date for 2020.&nbsp;As people now go online from phones more than laptops, most servers are in the cloud, online advertising drives the Internet and social networks have taken over much human interaction, many patterns of crime and abuse are the same, but the methods have evolved. Ross Anderson&nbsp;explores&nbsp;what&nbsp;security engineering&nbsp;means in 2020, including:&nbsp;
How the basic&nbsp;elements of cryptography, protocols, and access control&nbsp;translate to the new world of phones, cloud services, social media and the Internet of&nbsp;Things&nbsp;Who the attackers are –&nbsp;from&nbsp;nation states&nbsp;and&nbsp;business competitors&nbsp;through&nbsp;criminal gangs&nbsp;to&nbsp;stalkers and&nbsp;playground&nbsp;bullies&nbsp;What they do –&nbsp;from&nbsp;phishing&nbsp;and&nbsp;carding through&nbsp;SIM&nbsp;swapping&nbsp;and software&nbsp;exploits&nbsp;to DDoS and&nbsp;fake&nbsp;newsSecurity psychology,&nbsp;from&nbsp;privacy&nbsp;through&nbsp;ease-of-use&nbsp;to&nbsp;deception&nbsp;&nbsp;The economics of security&nbsp;and dependability –&nbsp;why companies build&nbsp;vulnerable&nbsp;systems and&nbsp;governments look the other&nbsp;way&nbsp;How dozens of industries went online – well or&nbsp;badly

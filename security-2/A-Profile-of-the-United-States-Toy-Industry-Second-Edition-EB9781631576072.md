Book Description
-----------------

 The toy industry is one of the most consistently misunderstood sectors of American business, comprising a wide range of businesses under one banner-entertainment, commodities, fashion and licensing-that each behave differently. Broad-based change is constant, with more than 40 percent of toy products new each year. The U.S. market comprises about 600 publicly and privately held companies, valued at about $22 billion per year at wholesale for traditional toys, which has remained relatively constant since the 1990s. It is also the only industry where success depends on the whims of a child. This book is a concise and in-depth introduction to the structure, practices, and market forces that impact the toy industry, including a short history, a description of the current market landscape, product trends, emerging opportunities and threats and expectations for the future, as well as aspects of retailing, consumer behavior, and financial markets. While the book's primary focus is the U.S. toy industry, one cannot ignore the global scope of the business, particularly related to manufacturing, growth potential and emerging markets. It is intended to provide a foundation for understanding the diverse and dynamic nature of the toy industry and many things that make it unique and to provide an introduction to this fast-paced, always changing and fiercely competitive business where success is often more an art than a science.

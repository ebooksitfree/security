Book Description
-----------------

 Customer-centric, market-driven solutions for fixing America’s broken healthcare system—from one of the industry’s most innovative thought leaders. Healthcare accounts for nearly a fifth of the U.S. economy. Everyone agrees that the current system is broken and in desperate need of repair. It should cost less, tackle chronic disease, and promote health. It requires a massive shift in resources from acute services to better care management, behavioral health, and primary care services. The question isn’t what to do. It’s how to do it. The revolution starts by meeting and supporting consumers’ real health needs. It’s time for American healthcare to serve the people.
This is The Customer Revolution in Healthcare. Written by leading healthcare strategist and commentator David W. Johnson, this groundbreaking book is more than a wake-up call. It’s a point-by-point action plan to:
• Blow up the “Healthcare Industrial Complex” • Liberate data and empower consumers with technology • Promote agile, innovative, and customer-centric “platform” companies • Reduce costs, improve service, and generate superior outcomes • Deliver personalized care with precisions and compassion • Explain and address America’s self-created opioid crisis • Provide affordable and accessible health insurance for all • Turbocharge the U.S. economy • Foster healthier communities  Revolutionary healthcare empowers patients and providers alike. Competitive healthcare companies reconfigure inefficient business models to deliver appropriate, accessible, holistic, and reliable care at lower costs. Caregivers engage patients with insight and compassion informed by real-time data and analytics. Payers reward health companies that deliver great outcomes and great service at competitive prices while keeping members as healthy as possible. Investors fund innovative companies whose products and services delight customers. And consumers receive compassionate, affordable, convenient healthcare that meets their needs.  Most important, The Customer Revolution in Healthcare provides a robust framework for aligning economic incentives with patient needs to deliver better outcomes at lower costs with superior customer service. The future of healthcare belongs to innovative customer-centric health companies that deliver kinder, smarter, more affordable care—to all.

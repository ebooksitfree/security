Book Description
-----------------

Edited by Takashi Yamaguchi, Mitsuo Hirate, and Chee Khiang Pang, with contributions from pioneers known for their ground-breaking work, High-Speed Precision Motion Control discusses high-precision and fast servo controls in hard disk drives (HDDs). The chapter authors describe the control technologies they’ve developed, most of which have already been successfully applied to mass production of HDDs. As the proposed methodologies have been verified on commercial HDDs at the very least, these advanced control technologies can also be readily applied to precision motion control of other mechatronic systems, e.g., scanners, micro-positioners, photocopiers, atomic force microscopes (AFMs), etc.
Each self-contained chapter progresses from concept to technique and presents application examples in automotive, aerospace, aeronautical, and manufacturing engineering. The control technologies are categorized into high-speed servo control, precision control, and environment-friendly control, making it easy to find an appropriate control technology according to their domain of application. The book also makes MATLAB®/SIMULINK® codes for benchmark problems available for download.
The control technologies described range from fundamental classical control theories to advanced topics such as multi-rate control. The content contains a healthy balance between materials from the contributor’s research works and that in the wider literature. The resulting resource empowers engineers and managers with the knowledge and know-how to make important decisions and policies.

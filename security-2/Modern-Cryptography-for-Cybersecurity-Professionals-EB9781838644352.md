Book Description
-----------------

As a cybersecurity professional, discover how to implement cryptographic techniques to help your organization mitigate the risks of altered, disclosed, or stolen data
Key FeaturesDiscover how cryptography is used to secure data in motion as well as at restCompare symmetric with asymmetric encryption and learn how a hash is usedGet to grips with different types of cryptographic solutions along with common applicationsIn today's world, it is important to have confidence in your data storage and transmission strategy. Cryptography can provide you with this confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation. But are you aware of just what exactly is involved in using cryptographic techniques? Modern Cryptography for Cybersecurity Professionals helps you to gain a better understanding of the cryptographic elements necessary to secure your data.
The book begins by helping you to understand why we need to secure data and how encryption can provide protection, whether it be in motion or at rest. You'll then delve into symmetric and asymmetric encryption and discover how a hash is used. As you advance, you'll see how the public key infrastructure (PKI) and certificates build trust between parties, so that we can confidently encrypt and exchange data. Finally, you'll explore the practical applications of cryptographic techniques, including passwords, email, and blockchain technology, along with securely transmitting data using a virtual private network (VPN).
By the end of this cryptography book, you'll have gained a solid understanding of cryptographic techniques and terms, learned how symmetric and asymmetric encryption and hashed are used, and recognized the importance of key management and the PKI.
What you will learnUnderstand how network attacks can compromise dataReview practical uses of cryptography over timeCompare how symmetric and asymmetric encryption workExplore how a hash can ensure data integrity and authenticationUnderstand the laws that govern the need to secure dataDiscover the practical applications of cryptographic techniquesFind out how the PKI enables trustGet to grips with how data can be secured using a VPNWho this book is forThis book is for IT managers, security professionals, students, teachers, and anyone looking to learn more about cryptography and understand why it is important in an organization as part of an overall security framework. A basic understanding of encryption and general networking terms and concepts is needed to get the most out of this book.

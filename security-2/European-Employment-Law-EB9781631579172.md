Book Description
-----------------

 Within Europe, employment law has grown as a result of regional rather than national legislation. The European Union has been at the fore of developing a comprehensive framework to protect workers from unfair practices and discrimination. In addition to the European Union, the Council of Europe also plays a role in protecting workers. The European Social Charter and the European Convention on Human Rights contain provisions relevant to the employment relationship. This publication will give the U.S. business student an overview of the key laws governing the area of employment in Europe. Here we look at the obligations and regulations surrounding the contract of employment, the laws surrounding equality and nondiscrimination, and the protection for unions and collective bargaining. Comparisons are drawn with American law and regulation at regular intervals to illustrate different practices within Europe and the United States. This book will provide the student with knowledge of the essential elements of European Employment Law in a concise and easy-to-understand manner.        Show and hide more

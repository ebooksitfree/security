Book Description
-----------------

The Art of Network Penetration Testing is a guide to simulating an internal security breach. You’ll take on the role of the attacker and work through every stage of a professional pentest, from information gathering to seizing control of a system and owning the network. As you brute force passwords, exploit unpatched services, and elevate network level privileges, you’ll learn where the weaknesses are—and how to take advantage of them.

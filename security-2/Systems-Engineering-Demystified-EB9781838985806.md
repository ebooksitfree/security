Book Description
-----------------

Get to grips with systems engineering life cycles, processes, and best practices and discover techniques to successfully develop complex systems
Key FeaturesDiscover how to manage increased complexity and understand systems better via effective communicationAdopt a proven model-based approach for systems engineering in your organizationApply proven techniques for requirements, design, validation and verification, and systems engineering managementSystems engineering helps us to understand, specify, and develop complex systems, and is applied across a wide set of disciplines. As systems and their associated problems become increasingly complex in this evermore connected world, the need for more rigorous, demonstrable, and repeatable techniques also increases.
Written by Professor Jon Holt – an internationally recognized systems engineering expert – this book provides a blend of technical and business aspects you need to understand in order to develop successful systems. You'll start with systems engineering basics and understand the complexity, communication, and different stakeholders' views of the system. The book then covers essential aspects of model-based systems engineering, systems, life cycles, and processes, along with techniques to develop systems. Moving on, you'll explore system models and visualization techniques, focusing on the SysML, and discover how solutions can be defined by developing effective system design, verification, and validation techniques. The book concludes by taking you through key management processes and systems engineering best practices and guidelines.
By the end of this systems engineering book, you'll be able to confidently apply modern model-based systems engineering techniques to your own systems and projects.
What you will learnUnderstand the three evils of systems engineering - complexity, ambiguous communication, and lack of understandingRealize successful systems using model-based systems engineeringUnderstand the concept of life cycles and how they control the evolution of a systemExplore processes and related concepts such as activities, stakeholders, and resourcesDiscover how needs fit into the systems life cycle and which processes are relevant and how to comply with themFind out how design, verification, and validation fit into the life cycle and processesWho this book is forThis book is for aspiring systems engineers, engineering managers, or anyone looking to apply systems engineering practices to their systems and projects. While a well-structured, model-based approach to systems engineering is an essential skill for engineers of all disciplines, many companies are finding that new graduates have little understanding of systems engineering. This book helps you acquire this skill with the help of a simple and practical approach to developing successful systems. No prior knowledge of systems engineering or modeling is required to get started with this book.

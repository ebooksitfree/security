Cloud native applications do more than just run on a different platform. The entire scope of these applications is different, including the methodologies and skills used to build them. Security practices for these applications need a transformation of equal magnitude.

Author Guy Podjarny explains this market transition and guides you through the organizational changes required to succeed, including alterations to security practices and tooling. Concrete examples not only help you learn the concepts but also act as an ideal way to get started in the process. By the end of this report, you'll understand why and how to embrace a CNAS approach.

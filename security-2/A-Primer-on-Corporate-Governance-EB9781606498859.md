Book Description
-----------------

 This book provides an understanding of the characteristics of corporate governance in Italy, one of the most developed countries in the world, symbol of the family capitalism. The text presents the main peculiarities of the Italian corporate governance system, its impact on decision-making in corporate boardrooms, and the potential positive and negative consequences for the firm and its stakeholders. Several real-life case studies were included to help the reader grasp the subtleties of how power is exercised in Italian companies. The authors combine their knowledge of research with their professional experience. Such an approach helps the reader interpret the nuances of corporate governance practices in Italian companies as those practices are driven not only by the globalization of markets, but also by national economic, social, and political forces. The result is a unique corporate governance system, which deeply differs from the Anglo-American one. This book is, therefore, particularly relevant for a wide international audience (including investors, corporate directors, scholars, and practitioners) as it provides useful insights to interpret, evaluate and take sound decisions in Italian companies.

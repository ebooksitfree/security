Book Description
-----------------

 For companies such as Amazon, Dropbox, and Gremlin, the term high severity incident (SEV) signifies drops in network availability, product feature issues, data loss, revenue loss, and security risks. These high-impact bugs occur when coding, automation, testing, and other engineering practices create issues that eventually reach the customerâ€”issues that can exist without detection for hours, days, weeks, and even years.
With this in-depth ebook, SREs, SRE managers, VPs of engineering, and CTOs will learn powerful methods for reducing MTTD through incident classification and leveling, tooling, monitoring, KPI metrics, alerting, observability, and chaos engineering. The authors share real-life experiences to explain how they achieved MTTD reduction results for companies including Gremlin, LinkedIn, Twitter, Amazon Web Services, Fuzzbox, and Samba TV.
This ebook dives into:
Incident classification: SEV descriptions and levels, and SEV and time-to-detection (TTD) timelinesOrganization-wide critical service monitoring, including key dashboards and KPI metrics emailsService ownership and metrics for organizations maintaining a microservice architectureEffective on-call principles for site reliability engineers, including rotation structure, alert threshold maintenance, and escalation practicesChaos engineering practices to identify random and unpredictable behavior in your systemMonitoring and metrics to detect incidents caused by self-healing systemsCreating a high-reliability culture by listening to people in your organization        Show and hide more

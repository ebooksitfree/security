Book Description
-----------------

 A Better Kind of Compliance TrainingCompliance training succeeds when you balance the needs of not just the organization but also the employees who you hope will learn and change their behavior.  In Fully Compliant, Travis Waugh challenges traditional compliance training that simply ensures employees avoid the legal risk of failing to comply with a specific mandate. With an ever-increasing number of compliance subjects to address, such programs are unsustainable. Instead, organizations must design compliance programs that serve a higher, broader purpose and build robust, resilient cultures focusing on integrity and ethics learning. Optimal compliance programs are flexible and create real learning experiences that change real behavior, thus diminishing the chance of misconduct in the first place. This book connects the three levers of human behavior―context, habits, and motivation―to compliance and how you can pull all three to create holistic training programs that do far more than check a box. It identifies ways to pick up small but meaningful wins in turning around an existing compliance program or designing a new course, which can turn stakeholders from skeptics into learning champions. And it offers an eight-step road map for implementing your own compliance learning plan. With this book, you'll be able to: • Create behavior-based compliance training that generates measurable benefits.• Make compliance training more engaging and impactful, not one size fits all.• Remain relevant as advances in technology shift compliance expectations in the years ahead. By putting the learner first, you can develop compliance that sticks.           Show and hide more

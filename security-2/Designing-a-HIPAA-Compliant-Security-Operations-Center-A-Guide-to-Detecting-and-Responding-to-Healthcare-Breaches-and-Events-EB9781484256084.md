Book Description
-----------------


    
    Develop a comprehensive plan for building a HIPAA-compliant security operations center, designed to detect and respond to an increasing number of healthcare data breaches and events. Using risk analysis, assessment, and management data combined with knowledge of cybersecurity program maturity, this book gives you the tools you need to operationalize threat intelligence, vulnerability management, security monitoring, and incident response processes to effectively meet the challenges presented by healthcare’s current threats. &nbsp;
Healthcare entities are bombarded with data. Threat intelligence feeds, news updates, and messages come rapidly and in many forms such as email, podcasts, and more. New vulnerabilities are found every day in applications, operating systems, and databases while older vulnerabilities remain exploitable. Add in the number of dashboards, alerts, and data points each information security tool provides and security teams find themselves swimming in oceans of data and unsure where to focus their energy. There is an urgent need to have a cohesive plan in place to cut through the noise and face these threats.
Cybersecurity operations do not require expensive tools or large capital investments. There are ways to capture the necessary data. Teams protecting data and supporting HIPAA compliance can do this. All that’s required is a plan—which author Eric Thompson provides in this book. 

What You Will Learn

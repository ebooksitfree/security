Book Description
-----------------

 Julie&#8217;s having a very bad day. She&#8217;s a new manager, and her top performer has resigned to escape her, and her own manager is looking on with a skeptical eye. . . . This is the story of her turnaround.   Being a first-time manager is a tough job. If you were Julie, what would you do?  Wouldn&#8217;t anyone, given the choice of taking on a leadership role (with a raise), or staying put, have done the same? But no one prepared her for developing co-workers, her former peers, while producing as before and leading the team. Now she&#8217;s in over her head.   Author Katy Tynan understands. In her new book, How Did I Not See This Coming? A Manager&#8217;s Guide to Avoiding Total Disaster, Tynan unlocks the truths about management, showing that first-time managers are basically on a journey without a map. It&#8217;s not that employers aren&#8217;t investing in their new managers, she says, or that the people in leadership don&#8217;t care, but they are no longer close to the raw experience of being a new manager. What&#8217;s more, most management books are written by experts who lack the memory of first-time failure.  In How Did I Not See This Coming?, Tynan tells the fictional story of Julie, a onetime star producer, to illustrate how a new manager can successfully make the shift from a role without leadership responsibilities to one with them. Along the way, Tynan offers the five basic truths about management&#8212;starting with recognizing team values and strengths&#8212;truths that can be learned by anyone.  You, too, can be the manager everyone&#8217;s talking about&#8212;in a good way&#8212;because you&#8217;re the one who figured it out.        Show and hide more

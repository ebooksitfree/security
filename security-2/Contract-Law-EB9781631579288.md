Book Description
-----------------

 This text serves as an accessible introduction to the law of contract. The headings chosen for examination track the main points in the lifetime of a contract-from its formation, drafting, and onward to its eventual dissolution, whether this occurs due to the terms of the contract, the will of the parties, or because of a breach of the agreed terms. It also provides studies of other notable areas within the subject, such as third-party rights, damages, and equitable remedies. In distinction to other guides to contract law, this text provides a comparative analysis of the area, incorporating sources drawn from both the civil law tradition, characteristic of several nations within Continental Europe, as well as the Anglo-American common law tradition, with cases and legislation drawn from England and the United States of America. It also explores contract law in the unique context of so-called hybrid jurisdictions-those that incorporate elements of both the common law and civilian traditions. As business assumes a global dimension, knowledge of the operation of contract law across various legal traditions and national contexts is increasingly at a premium. This text enables the student to gain a coherent vision of contract law, as well as to speak confidently when discussing the intricacies of the subject.        Show and hide more
